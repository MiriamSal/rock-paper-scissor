## **week 4 building the game rock-paper-scissor**

### **Work flow**
#### **I will start by writing the user story**
#### **I choose to build the game in Ruby becouse it is a flexible and writer friendly language that lets me as a programmer work with shorter blocks of code and allows me to be creative**
#### **I will use RSpec to unittest, css plus Tailwind for styling and deploy the site using Netlify**

### **User story**
#### **As a player of the rps game, I want to compete against a computer**
#### **I want to choose between rock, paper and scissor and see the computers pick**
#### **I want to be given the result, and the choise to play again**

### **Rules of the game**
#### **Rock vs Paper: Paper wins**
#### **Rock vs Scissor: Rock wins**
#### **Paper vs Scissor: Scissor wins**
