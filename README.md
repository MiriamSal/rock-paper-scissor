## **week 4 building the game rock-paper-scissor**

### **Work flow**
#### **I will start by writing the user story**
#### **I choose to build the game in Javascript because it works nicely when building games, and gives me as a programmer a variety of options when styling togehther with css and Tailwind. I use RSpec for testing and deploying through Netlify**

### **User story**
#### **As a player of the rps game, I want to compete against a computer**
#### **I want to choose between rock, paper and scissor and see the computers pick**
#### **I want to be given the result, and the choise to play again**

### **Rules of the game**
#### **Rock vs Paper: Paper wins**
#### **Rock vs Scissor: Rock wins**
#### **Paper vs Scissor: Scissor wins**
